# training_pcap_maker
 a helper to make basic pcap to test a multitude of aptitude
 
 for it to work you will need 
 - a postfix server runing in the lan. 
    - In the postfix server we need at least one account but for realism we should have more than one 
- a ollama server running with llama3 model to make the email information
- a directory with files for the joint pieces the email will be allowed to select from. 

- a browser allowing search from the script
- multiple vm or devices on the lan to make noise. (minimum of one more than your host) 

- a FTP server running with a couple of files to share.


main problem : I did not make a windows anything with windows server which mean for our current activity this is lacking.
